# Flower classification project

## Overview

The task for this project was to classify flowers according to their species. This is my first attempt using pytorch and deep learning

The goal was to build a model to classify images and then build a terminal application using the code contained in the notebook.

# Files 

Image Classifier Project.ipynb: contains the code for the image classification task

train.py: code for training images using deep learning in a terminal application

predict(1).py: code for predicting images labels using a trained deep learning model in a terminal application

m_func.py: contains the functions needed to run each the train application and the predict application.

cat_to_name.json: contains the name-label pairs of each flower.
