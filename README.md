# Udacity Flower classification project

My submission to the udacity pytorch image classification project, which task was to classify flowers according to their species.

This was my first attempt into a deep learning task and helped me a lot to understand how NN's are constructed and how they work.

Additional to this first script there are other three that contain code to create a terminal application of the flower classification task, these three are divided into train, test and functions scripts. This app was also part of the Udacity deep learning project.

As mentioned above, in order to work with this project, the pytorch library must be installed as well as other common libraries that you surely have but if not, you can find them inside the script.
